# Nexgit

Nexgit is an early-stage open-source project for building a better Git workflow tool: a serious headless CLI, a keyboard-first TUI, and a polished desktop app for stacked changes and GitHub-style collaboration.

This repository is being developed as a university club project. The goal is to be welcoming to new contributors while still using practices that look like a real open-source project.

## What Nexgit is trying to become

Nexgit aims to provide:

- Headless commands for scripts and automation.
- A Ratatui terminal UI for fast keyboard workflows.
- A desktop GUI inspired by stacked-diff tools like Graphite.
- A local app-server exposed by the Rust CLI, similar in shape to Codex's app-server model.
- Shared Rust core logic so the CLI, TUI, and desktop app behave consistently.

## Current architecture

```text
Desktop React UI
  ↓ window.nexgit preload API
Electron main process
  ↓ newline-delimited JSON over stdio://
nexgit app-server
  ↓
Rust core logic
```

The desktop app starts the Rust CLI in app-server mode:

```bash
nexgit app-server --listen stdio://
```

The app-server also has scaffolding for:

```bash
nexgit app-server --listen ws://127.0.0.1:0
nexgit app-server --listen unix://
```

## Quick start

Nexgit supports two development environment entrypoints. Choose one.

### Option A: mise

```bash
mise install
pnpm install
pnpm check
```

### Option B: Nix flake

```bash
nix develop
pnpm install
pnpm check
```

See [Development environments](docs/environments.md) for details. The project docs intentionally avoid separate manual toolchain installation instructions; `mise.toml` and `flake.nix` are the supported environment definitions.

### Run the CLI/TUI

```bash
cargo run -p nexgit-cli -- tui
```

### Run headless command stubs

```bash
cargo run -p nexgit-cli -- repo status --json
cargo run -p nexgit-cli -- stack list --json
```

### Run the app-server directly

```bash
cargo run -p nexgit-cli -- app-server --listen stdio://
```

Smoke test the protocol:

```bash
printf '{"type":"request","id":1,"method":"system.version","params":{}}\n' \
  | cargo run -q -p nexgit-cli -- app-server --listen stdio://
```

### Run the desktop app

```bash
pnpm desktop:dev
```

The desktop app will try to use `NEXGIT_CLI_PATH` first. If it is not set, it looks for `target/debug/nexgit`. If that binary is missing, it falls back to running Cargo directly.

## Useful commands

```bash
pnpm format
pnpm format:check
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm check
pnpm nix:check
cargo check --workspace
```

Root pnpm shortcuts:

```bash
pnpm tui
pnpm app-server
pnpm desktop:dev
pnpm desktop:build
pnpm desktop:typecheck
```
